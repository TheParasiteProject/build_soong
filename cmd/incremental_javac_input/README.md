# Incremental Javac Input

[incremental_javac_input] command line tool. This tool can be used to find the correct subset
of java files to be passed for incremental javac compilation.

# Getting Started

## Inputs
* rsp file, containing list of java source files separated by whitespace.
* deps file, containing the cross-module dependencies for javac.
* javacTarget path to the output jar of javac
* srcDepsProto, path to a proto file representing dependencies across java source files.
* localHeaderJars *(optional)* rsp file containing space separated header jar path(s) for java sources.

## Output
* [javacTarget].inc.rsp file, representing list of java source files for incremental compilation.
* [javacTarget].rem.rsp file, representing the list of .class files whose sources were removed and hence should be cleaned.
* [javacTarget].input.pc_state.new temp state file, representing the current state of all java sources.
* [javacTarget].deps.pc_state.new temp state file, representing the current state of cross-module dependencies.
* [javacTarget].headers.pc_state.new temp state file, representing the current state of java source headers.

## Usage
```
incremental_javac_input --srcs [srcRspFile] --deps [depsRspFile] --javacTarget [javacTargetPath] --srcDepsProto [srcDepsProtoPath] --localHeaderJars [localHeaderJarsRspFile]
```

## Notes
* This tool internally references the core logic of [find_input_delta] tool.
* All outputs are relative to the javacTarget path
* Same sources, deps, headers when used for different targets will output different results.
* Once javac succeeds, the temp state files should be saved as current state files, to prepare for next iteration.
